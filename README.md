# Welcome to Playbase

A visually pleasing listening environment for Spotify. Search for albums, add to your collection, flip through your virtual shelf, and listen- all in the Playbase app!

### Motivation

We wanted to build an app that created an 'analog' feel for listening to your favorite albums on Spotify. Flipping through records is a very satisfying, and we aimed to recreate the experience with this application
