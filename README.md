### Inspiration

We wanted to create an alternative music playing app that mimicked the "analog," record playing feel for listening to your favorite albums on Spotify. Flipping through records is a very satisfying, and listening to albums all the way through without skipping tracks was something we aimed to recreate the experience with this application.

### Built With

#### Backend

* Ruby [2.6.1]
* Rails [6.0.3]
* PostgreSQL v13, gem [1.2.3]
* OAuth [0.5.1]

#### Frontend

* React [16.13.1]
* Semantic UI React [1.3.1]
* Custom SASS/CSS

### Executing the Program

Fork and clone the Playbase repo

Run bundle install  
Run rails db:migrate
